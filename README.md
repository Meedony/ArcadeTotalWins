# ArcadeTotalWins
The ArcadeTotalWins plugin is an addon to the Arcade Minigames plugin.

**Placeholder:** `%arcadetotal_wins%`

# Installation
Just drop it in your plugins folder and you'reready to go, there is no any type of configuration to this plugin.


# IMPORTANT

**This plugin is NOT affiliated with the Arcade Minigames plugin, I'm not even sure if I'm allowed to share it without permission**

It's only a temporary plugin until the Arcade plugin adds the total wins placeholder.
